# Vonage Java Server SDK SpringBoot Demo App
This repo demonstrates usage of the [Vonage APIs](https://developer.vonage.com/en/api)
using the [Vonage Java Server SDK](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-java-sdk). It is built
as a Spring Boot 3 web application.

The purpose of this is to provide an interactive demo for our APIs.
Unlike the [Java code snippets repo](https://github.com/Vonage/vonage-java-code-snippets),
you can see the snippets in action live without an IDE or local setup!

This project is also designed to be deployed on [Vonage Cloud Runtime](https://developer.vonage.com/en/vcr/overview).
